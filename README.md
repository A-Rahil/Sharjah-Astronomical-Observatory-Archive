# Sharjah Astronomical Observatory Archive (Proof of Concept)

![Project Screenshot](/images/screenshot.png) <!-- Add a screenshot later -->

## Overview

This project is a functional frontend prototype for an astronomical observation archive, developed for the Sharjah Academy for Astronomy, Space Sciences & Technology. The interface demonstrates:

- Dynamic filtering of solar system and deep-sky objects
- Responsive form validation
- Simulated data loading states
- Ready-to-connect frontend architecture

**Key Achievement**: This proof-of-concept successfully demonstrates a complete user interface that awaits backend integration.

## Technical Status

âœ… **Frontend Complete**:  
- Fully responsive UI/UX  
- Form validation logic  
- Mock data display system  

âœ… **Database Ready**:  
- MySQL database structure finalized  
- Sample observation data schema prepared  

ðŸš€ **Next Steps**:  
- Connect to existing observatory database  
- Deploy to production server  

## How It Works

1. **User Selects** observation parameters:
   - Category (Solar System/Deep Sky)
   - Specific astronomical object
   - Observation date (for solar system)

2. **System Displays** simulated results:
   - Currently shows placeholder content
   - Ready to display real observations after integration

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/astronomical-archive.git
